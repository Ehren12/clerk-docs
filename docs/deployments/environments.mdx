# Instances / Environments
When creating a new application within Clerk, you are provided with two instances: `Development` and `Production`.  These instances vary slightly and should only be used appropriately.

## Development instance
A `Development` instance is Clerk's default instance type and has characteristics that allow it to be more useful for local development. To facilitate development and local authentication, `Development` instances have a more relaxed security posture and are not suitable for production workloads.

Some notable examples of `Development`-only characteristics in a Clerk application are: 
- A `Development` banner is shown prominently in the Clerk Dashboard to make clear you're managing or configuring non-production data
- Email and SMS templates are prefixed with the environment type to prevent against using `Development` instances for production purposes
- Some social connections use shared credentials by default 
- Certain functionality, like bot protection, is only available in `Production` mode
- [The Account Portal](/docs/account-portal/overview) will use a Clerk development domain that ends with `accounts.dev` instead of your app's production domain
- OAuth consent screens will show the development domain that ends with `accounts.dev` instead of your production domain
- Search engines will not be able to crawl and index your application
- Development instances have a 500 users cap and user data can not be transferred between instances

<Callout type="info">
  All paid functionality is available in a `Development` instance. However, when you deploy your application to `Production`, you will be asked to upgrade to a `Pro` account. See [our pricing page](/pricing) for full details.
</Callout>

## Production instance
A `Production` instance is the more robust option of Clerk's instance types. `Production` instances are meant to support high volumes of traffic and by default, have a more strict security posture.

Some notable differences between `Production` and `Development` instances in a Clerk application are: 
- You must associate a production domain within the Clerk Dashboard
- You are required to provision your own SSO credentials 

When deploying to production, you must first activate your `Production` environment. Check out Clerk's [Deploying to Production](/docs/deployments/overview#deploying-to-production) guide to learn about the process and avoid common pitfalls.

## Staging environments

Clerk does not currently support staging instances in Clerk apps, however you can configure Clerk to work with your staging environment. See [Set up staging](/docs/deployments/set-up-staging) to learn more.

## Preview environments

Popular hosting providers such as Cloudflare, Vercel, and more, offer preview deployments, which enable you to view changes to your site in a live environment before merging and deploying them to production.

### Recommended preview setup

It is recommended that you use your Clerk app's development instance API keys when accessing Clerk from a preview deployment.

  See the [development instance](#development-instance) section to learn about the limitations to development instance API keys.

### Vercel preview deployment suffix

To use Clerk with Vercel's preview deployment suffix, you must have a Pro or Enterprise Vercel account. The following steps will teach you how to configure your Vercel preview deployment suffix with Clerk:

1. **Acquire a separate domain** – This domain will be used for your preview environment, and _cannot be a subdomain_ of the domain used in your production environment. For example, if your production domain is `my-site.com`, you could use `my-site-previews.com`.
1. **Follow the Deploy to Vercel guide** – See [the Preview URL section of the Deploy to Vercel guide](/docs/deployments/deploy-to-vercel#support-for-vercel-preview-ur-ls) to configure your app.
1. **Contact Clerk support to provision a preview-specific Clerk app for free** – If you're on a Pro, Enterprise, or Startup plan, Clerk will provision a dedicated preview-specific Clerk application with all the same features as your main applicatin for free.
