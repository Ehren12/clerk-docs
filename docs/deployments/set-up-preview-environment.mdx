# Set up a preview environment with Clerk

Popular hosting providers such as Cloudflare, Vercel, and more, offer preview deployments, which enable you to view changes to your site in a live environment before merging and deploying them to production.

## Recommended setup

It is recommended that you use your Clerk app's development instance API keys when accessing Clerk from a preview deployment. You should add them to your environment variables.

  See the [development instance](#development-instance) section to learn about the limitations to development instance API keys.

The following are environment variable guides from some popular providers:
    - [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables#declare-an-environment-variable)
    - [Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/environment-variables/get-started/#create-environment-variables)
    - [Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/environment-variables/#add-environment-variables-via-the-dashboar)

## Vercel preview deployment suffix

To use Clerk with Vercel's preview deployment suffix, you must have a Pro or Enterprise Vercel account. The following steps will teach you how to configure your Vercel preview deployment suffix with Clerk:

1. **Acquire a separate domain** – This domain will be used for your preview environment, and _cannot be a subdomain_ of the domain used in your production environment. For example, if your production domain is `my-site.com`, you could use `my-site-previews.com`.
1. **Follow the Deploy to Vercel guide** – See [the Preview URL section of the Deploy to Vercel guide](/docs/deployments/deploy-to-vercel#support-for-vercel-preview-ur-ls) to configure your app.
1. **Contact Clerk support to provision a preview-specific Clerk app for free** – If you're on a Pro, Enterprise, or Startup plan, Clerk will provision a dedicated preview-specific Clerk application with all the same features as your main applicatin for free.
1. **Use production instance API keys** – Once Clerk support has provisioned your free preview-specific Clerk app, you should use its production instance API keys with your previews, as this offers better security and fewer limitations. See [the production instance documentation](/docs/deployments/environments#production-instance) to learn more.

### Limitations

- This approach requires a Vercel Pro or Enterprise account.
- When you use a separate Clerk application for your preview environment, changes to this application will not be automatically mirrored in your main application for your production environment. You must manually make these changes yourself.
- This approach locks you into using Vercel for preview environments.

## Staging environments

You can also use Clerk with [staging environments](/docs/deployments/set-up-preview-environment).
