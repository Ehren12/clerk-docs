# Set up a staging environment with Clerk

Staging environments enable you to internally test and demo changes to your application or website before deploying them to production. Official support for staging is still on [Clerk's roadmap](https://feedback.clerk.com/roadmap/de417dd1-fa2e-4997-868f-4c9248027e7d), however you can use Clerk in your staging environments with the approaches described in this guide.

## Choose an approach

There are two recommended approaches to using Clerk in a staging environment at this time:

1. [Using a separate domain from your production app's domain](#use-a-staging-domain). Choose this if you:
    - Don't already have a subdomain of your production app
    - Can integrate a new staging-specific domain into your current workflow
1. [Using a subdomain of your production app's domain](#use-a-subdomain). Choose this if you:
    - Can't currently integrate a new staging-specific domain into your workflow

Alternatively, you can [use Clerk with your preview deployments]().

## Use a staging domain

When setting up staging with Clerk, it is recommended that you use a separate domain from your production domain. Doing so will enable you to create a new Clerk app for your staging environment, preventing you from using production environment data and API keys. **This staging Clerk app will be upgraded free of charge**.

### Benefits of this approach

Using a separate domain and Clerk application enables you to:

- Use a Clerk production instance for your staging environment, offering improved security over development instances. See [Instances / Environments](/docs/deployments/environments#production-instance) for more information.
- Fetch and modify data from Clerk without affecting your production data
- Avoid using live customer data in your staging environment
- Prevent your production application's users from being able to sign in to your staging environment

#### Limitations

- When you use a separate Clerk application for your staging environment, changes to this application will not be automatically mirrored in your main application for your production environment. You must manually make these changes yourself. 

### Set up a staging Clerk app

The following steps will help you set up a new Clerk application with a staging-specific domain:

1. **Acquire a new domain** – This new domain will be used for your staging environment. **This cannot be a subdomain**. For example, if your production domain is `my-site.com`, you could use `my-site-staging.com`. To use a subdomain instead, see [its dedication section](#use-a-subdomain).
1. **Create a new Clerk app** – Your staging environment will connect to this app instead of your main Clerk application. See [the Clerk quickstart guide](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk#create-a-clerk-application) to learn how to create a Clerk app.
1. **Deploy and configure your staging app's production instance** – Using production API keys will make your staging app more secure. Follow the [Deploy to production](/docs/deployments/overview#deploying-to-production) guide to do so.
1. **Contact Clerk support to upgrade your staging app for free** – If you're on a Pro, Enterprise, or Startup plan, Clerk will fully upgrade your staging app for free.

## Use a subdomain
