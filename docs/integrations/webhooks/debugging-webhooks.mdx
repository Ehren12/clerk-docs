description: Understand how to debug your webhooks while developing your application
---

Developing with webhooks can be a new experience for developers. It can be hard to debug when something goes awry. This guide will cover the basics for debugging and help you to direct your attention to the correct spot.

## Understanding webhooks and local development

When you or a user of your application performs certain actions, a webhook can be triggered. You can see the full list of [webhook events](/docs/integrations/webhooks/overview#supported-webhook-events) to see the various actions that could result in a Webhook. Depending on the events subscribed to in the [Webhook section](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=webhooks) of your dashboard, a webhook will be triggered.

When you are developing on your localhost, your application is not internet facing. It can't receive the webhook request. You will need to use a tool that creates a tunnel from the internet to your localhost. These tools will provide temporary or permanant URLs depending on the tool and the plan you subscribe to. Popular tools included `ngrok`, `localtunnel` and `Cloudflare Tunnel`.

Below is an image demonstrating the flow from when you perform an action that triggers a webhook through until the webhook is received by your application

## Debugging

With the Webhook flow in mind, the following areas could cause problems when trying to develop with webhooks:

1. The webhook route is not correctly configured
2. Configuration in your dashboard
3. The tunnel being used
4. Verification of the webhook
5. The logic you created to process the webhook


### Testing your Webhook route locally

If you are having trouble with your webhook, you can create a basic response and then test it locally. First, add the following file and code to your app. Also make sure that you add `ignoredRoutes: ['/api/webhooks(.*)']` to your `authMiddleware()`.

```ts filename="app/webhooks/test/route.ts"
export async function POST() {
   return Response.json({ message: 'The webhook route is working' });
}
```

While your application is running, try this from the command line.

```bash
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/test
```

If you see the `{"message":"The webhook route is working"}` then the basic webhook route is working, and ready to build on.


### Configuration in your dashboard

Whether you are developing locally or deploying to production, the webhook URL provided must be exact and correct. The URL breaks down into three parts -- the protocol (`http` vs `https`), the domain (`domain.com`) and the path (`/api/webhooks/user`).
- Whether in development using a tunnel or in production, the URL will almost always use `https`.
- The domain needs to be exact. A common error in production is not including the `www.`. Unlike entering a domain in your browser, a webhook will not be redirect from `domain.com` to `www.domain.com`. If your application lives on `www.domain.com` then the webhook URL must use that.
- The path must match the path in your application.

### Debugging your tunnel

You've setup your route and tested it, configured your tunnel, updated your dashboard and now are trying to use the webhook but are getting errors. You will want to visit the [Webhook section](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=webhooks) of your dashboard and the select the webhook you created.

You will see a 'Webhook Attempts' section and likely see that one or more of those attempts have failed. Click on the failed attempt to expand it. In the details for the attempt, there will be a 'HTTP RESPONSE CODE'. The code will likely be either a 500 or something starting with a 4, like 401 or 404. See [HTTP response status codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) from MDN for reference.

Below is a table with some of the common response codes you might see, and what they indicate:

| Code | Information |
| ---- | ----------- |
| 400  | This error usually indicates the verification failed, but could be caused by other issues |
| 401  | The request was not authorized. If your test in 'Testing your Webhook route locally' worked, you should not see this error. If you are seeing it, then you will need to configure your Middleware to accept the request, |
| 404  | The URL for the webhook was not found. This indicates that either the URL you added to the Webhook in the dashboard was incorrect, your application is not running, or the path is wrong.|
| 405  | Your route is not accepting a POST request. All webhooks are POST requests, to the route must accept them. Unless you are using the route for somethinh else, you can restrict the route to POST requests only. |
| 500  | A 500 error indicates that something failed in the webhook code. The request made it to your application, but there is a code related issue.

You may run into other errors. A 4xx error will indicate there is some misconfiguration in the configuration.

### Debugging the verification process

To verify the webhook, your webhook route will need the Signing Secret from the Webhook section of the dashboard as well of the Svia headers which are included in the request. Please see [Create the endpoint in your application](/docs/integrations/webhooks/sync-data#create-the-endpoint-in-your-application) for details code examples. You can also visit the [guide](https://docs.svix.com/receiving/verifying-payloads/how) on verifying webhooks with the Svix library.

Diagnosing a problem in this part of the webhook can be challenging. Your best get would be the liberal use of `console.log`. You could log out the following to check if the values are correct:
- the signing secret
- the headers
- the `body` before verifying
- the result of the `.verify()` attempt

The results of these will appear in the command line where you are running your application.

Checking the values and the progress of the webhook code will allow you to narrow down where the code is failing. The will often return null or errors where they should be returning values.

## Debugging your logic

Once you have verified the webhook, you will now be writing your own code to handle the values from the webhook. This could range from saving data to a databse, or integrating with another system, to updating users or sending emails or SMS. If the webhook is verified and you are seeing a 500 status code or your webhook is not behaving as expected, remember that you can use `console.log` to help diagnose what the problem is. Console logs and error will be displayed on your command line, allowing you to see what's happening and address the bugs.
